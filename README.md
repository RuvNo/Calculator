# Calculator
This Website acts as a fully functional calculator.

## Instructions
- Just enter your numbers.
- The calculator works with "normal" logic, i.e. exponential > brackets > multiplication/division > addition/subtraction
- If you want to, check out what happens if you happen to miss a closing parenthesis or type in an invalid expression. ;)

Have fun calculating!
